# TODO

## Primary
[x] Fix text basic interaction logic (tap to next if finished animating, tap to complete animation if still animating)
[-] Implement looping for AudioManager
[-] Fix foreground sprite positioning (also across devices)
[-] Should probably have a newline (wrap) after every `text` instruction

## Secondary
[-] Fix portrait/landscape mode switch on iPad
