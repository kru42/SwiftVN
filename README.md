# SwiftVN
[![Build](https://github.com/kru42/SwiftVN/actions/workflows/swift.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kru42/SwiftVN/actions)

**NOTE**: the code sucks and it's mostly AI, the project is incomplete as of now and novels aren't yet playable... basically, DO NOT RUN, and don't read the code if you don't want to pull your hair out.

SwiftVN is a VNDS visual novel format player targeting iOS >= 17.0. It uses Apple SpriteKit for rendering and VLCKit for decoding sounds and music.
